# Description
A simple editor for creating 2D games. It is built on top of the MonoGame/XNA framework

# Games built with Charisma

• Bad elf

A 2D Christmas-themed shooter platformer where you collect keys and shoot bad elves.

This game was my midterm and final project for my game programming 3 class at FEU Institute of Technology. The game was built using the MonoGame Framework and Piskel (https://github.com/piskelapp/piskel) for the assets.

The stable build can be accessed in the master branch.

• Bad Elf Level Editor

A simple in-game editor that pops up when you press 'T'. 

This brings up the environment assets. For now, you can scroll through the different environment objects using the number keys (0-9). The ingame UI lists all the environment objects. I plan on extending this to have its own application, complete with GUI elements to ease level design and development.

This was the feature that gave me the idea of creating Charisma2D.
