# Bad elf
A 2D Christmas-themed shooter platformer where you collect keys and shoot bad elves.

This game was my midterm and final project for my game programming 3 class at FEU Institute of Technology. The game was built using the MonoGame Framework and Piskel (https://github.com/piskelapp/piskel) for the assets.

Currently, it serves as a test bed for programming techniques and feature testing. 

# Level Editor
A simple in-game editor that pops up when you press 'T'. 

This brings up the environment assets. For now, you can scroll through the different environment objects using the number keys (0-9). The ingame UI lists all the environment objects. I plan on extending this to have its own application, complete with GUI elements to ease level design and development.

# Upcoming Features
I plan on adding other things such as Co-Op, Cross-platform Play (PC and Mobile), and hopefully learning AI as a way for me to get into Machine Learning.
